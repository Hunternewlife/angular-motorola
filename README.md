## responsivenes & comments about this approach

I have created a full resposive. using difernt approaches to the layouts so please take a look at the code, for example changing grid colums in angular by directives, using view ports in scss to change views and resizing based on the most common W * H dimensions, or using grid to responsivenes in a modern way. We have burned data from js to auto fill some frames, basic interfaces for those, a carousel responsive for the cards view. most of the project have material items. if you want I to generate a new version with boostrap or pure css please let me know 


angular was used for components navigation etc, it is my main framework, happy to study and learn if needed react or vue if needed.
