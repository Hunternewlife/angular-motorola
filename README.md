## responsivenes & comments about this approach

I have created a full resposive mainly base on vw sizes but also rem, vh. using difernt approaches to the layouts so please take a look at the code, for example changing grid colums in angular by directives, using view ports in scss to change views and resizing based on the mot commong W * H dimensions. We have burned data from js to auto fill some frames, basic interfaces for those, a carousel responsive for the cards view. most of the project have material items. (I want to emphatyze that is my first time using material I just want to challenge myself to it for me is easier Boostrap or plain css) if you want I to generate a new version with boostrap or pure css please let me know 

Angulra was used for components navigation etc, it is my main framework, happy to study and learn if needed react or vue if needed.
